# Commit Reminder

- Displays a notification when you've made more line changes without staging/committing than the set threshold (promotes small and frequent commits!)

2. Set reminder thresholds with the `Change Global Default Threshold` and `Change Workspace Threshold` commands
3. Enable autochecking with any of the following:
	- `Start Auto Change Checking` command
